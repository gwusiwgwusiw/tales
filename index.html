                        <p>The Manhattanville neighborhood remained agricultural throughout much of the 19th century, but slowly industrialized throughout the latter half by virtue of its low lying access to the waterfront. Remnants of this industrial history are still seen on the western side of our block on 12th Ave beneath the viaduct, and along the south side of 133rd St. Through the middle of the 20th century it was home to a private pool, before the area was cleared for the current development.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Block 2001 is located on the border of Manhattanville and Hamilton Heights in West Harlem. 
                        The block runs from 133rd to 135th St and is dominated by a large multi-use complex that dwarfs the adjacent buildings. 
                        3333 Broadway was completed in 1976 during a time when the city was still constructing large mega projects. 
                        The development was intended to be a multi-use facility from the outset and was constructed using $54 million from the Educational Construction Fund. 
                        It contains 1,200 units in 5 different buildings ranging from 10 to 35 stories. 
                        It is currently managed by Urban American, a company which also manages buildings on Roosevelt Island. 
                        In recent years, several news outlets have reported of consistent issues with maintenance, which is evidenced by the high number of 311 calls originating at the facility.</p>
                        <h4>KIPP</h4>
                        <p>The school complex in on the ground level of 3333 Broadway is occupied in part by KIPP (Knowledge Is Power Program), a charter school group that administers several schools throughout the city.  is to come into communities where children are generally underserved educationally and to provide them with options. KIPP’s mission includes several community outreach initiatives that include programming that features learning activities - from math workshops to harvesting their community garden - for students and their families. The school markets itself as a partnership between the staff, students, and families. However, a 2011 survey concludes that KIPP’s approach showed no significant impacts on student motivation, engagement, behavior, and educational aspirations. Yet, KIPP elementary and middle schools had positive impacts on parent satisfaction, suggesting that their community outreach initiatives establish trust among parents and guardians of students.</p><br>
